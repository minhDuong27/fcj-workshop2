### Overall Evaluation

**1. Working Environment**  
The working environment at FCJ is comfortable and easy to adapt to. Everyone is supportive and willing to help whenever I run into difficulties, even outside learning hours. The workspace is organized and quiet, which helps me stay focused. It would be even better if we had more team bonding sessions to get to know each other more.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**  
My mentor provides clear explanations and guides me step-by-step while still giving me space to try solving things on my own first. The admin team is very helpful with documents, logistics, and creating a smooth experience throughout the internship. I really appreciate that my mentor encourages me to ask questions instead of being afraid of making mistakes.

**3. Relevance to My Major**  
Most of the tasks match the subjects I studied at university, and I was also exposed to many new topics such as cloud operations and DevOps practices. This mixture helped me reinforce my foundation while gaining hands-on experience.

**4. Learning & Skill Development Opportunities**  
During this internship, I learned how to use new technical tools, improved my teamwork ability, and practiced professional communication. My mentor also shared real-world insights that helped me understand more clearly how the cloud industry works and what skills I need moving forward.

**5. Team Culture & Collaboration**  
The culture in FCJ is very positive. People respect each other and keep a friendly atmosphere even when the workload increases. I always felt included as part of the team, despite being an intern.

**6. Internship Policies & Benefits**  
Although there is no internship allowance, the flexible scheduling and chances to join internal workshops are very valuable to me.
