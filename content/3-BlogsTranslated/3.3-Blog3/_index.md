AWS provides a comprehensive service reference dataset that helps organizations manage their AWS service usage more securely and efficiently. This dataset includes detailed information about IAM permissions, data, APIs, supported actions, and conditions for every AWS service. Customers can use this dataset to automate the creation, review, and management of IAM policies.

Below is an overview of how AWS describes the use of this information to automate policy management workflows.

---

# 1. Purpose of the AWS Service Reference Dataset

The dataset helps organizations:

- Automate IAM policy creation.  
- Analyze usage to identify excessive permissions.  
- Reduce over-privileged access following the least-privilege principle.  
- Integrate into review, audit, or change-management workflows.

The dataset includes:

- All supported actions for each AWS service.  
- IAM permissions required for those actions.  
- The resource types each action applies to.  
- Supported condition keys.

# 2. Core Usage Models

Organizations can apply the AWS service reference dataset across multiple use cases:

## Automated IAM Policy Generation

Using CloudTrail data together with the dataset, organizations can:

- Identify the actions an application actually performs.  
- Generate just-in-time IAM policies based on real usage.  
- Avoid granting unnecessary permissions.

## Policy Optimization

Automated tooling can:

- Detect unused actions.  
- Suggest removal of excessive permissions.  
- Highlight differences between granted and used permissions.

## Assisting Accurate Policy Authoring

The dataset provides:

- Correct IAM action names.  
- Supported resource types for each action.  
- Applicable condition keys.

This reduces errors when writing policies manually.

## Automating Policy Review and Approval

Organizations can use the dataset to:

- Validate policies before approval.  
- Check whether an IAM action is valid.  
- Automatically reject policies requesting unnecessary permissions.

# 3. Available Data in the Reference Dataset

The dataset includes:

- AWS service list.  
- IAM action sets for each service.  
- Supported resource types for each action.  
- Allowed condition keys.  
- Documentation mappings for permissions and APIs.

AWS updates the dataset monthly.

# 4. Automating Policy Management Workflows

A complete system may combine:

- CloudTrail (real API usage logs).  
- The IAM service reference dataset (to validate actions and resources).  
- A policy review and approval pipeline.

Typical workflow:

1. Collect API usage from CloudTrail.  
2. Compare against IAM reference data to determine required permissions.  
3. Generate or suggest policy updates.  
4. Submit the policy to an approval pipeline.  
5. Automatically apply approved policy changes.

# 5. Key Benefits

- Stronger security through least-privilege access.  
- Automated workflows reduce manual effort.  
- Lower risk of human errors.  
- Better visibility into permission changes.  
- Smooth integration with DevOps processes.

# 6. Conclusion

The AWS service reference dataset provides a foundational resource enabling organizations to automate IAM policy management. Combined with CloudTrail and workflow automation, it allows teams to build precise, secure, and intelligent policy systems with reduced risk and improved governance.
