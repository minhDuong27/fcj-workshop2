During my internship at **Amazon Web Services Vietnam Co., Ltd.** from **September 8th, 2025 to December 12th, 2025**, I had the opportunity to apply what I learned in school to real-world tasks and observe how large-scale cloud environments operate.  
By joining the **First Cloud Journey** program, I improved my skills in **communication, teamwork, time management**, and gained deeper knowledge in **AWS services and cloud practices**.

Throughout the internship, I consistently aimed to complete my tasks on time, follow company guidelines, and collaborate actively with my teammates and mentors.
