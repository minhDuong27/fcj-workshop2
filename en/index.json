	"content": "Understanding the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) Regime: What Customers Need to Know On November 12, 2024, the UK financial services regulators — the Bank of England (BoE), the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) — published the final documents for the UK Critical Third Parties (CTPs) regime. These documents clarify how the regime will be implemented and expand regulatory oversight to specific services that designated CTPs provide to the UK financial sector.\nAWS is preparing to comply with this regime, assuming it will be designated as a CTP.\nKey Regulatory Changes Two core documents define the regime:\nSupervisory Statement (SS) 6/24 Critical Third Parties Instrument The Instrument sets the mandatory requirements for designated CTPs, while SS6/24 provides guidance on interpreting and implementing those requirements. Together, they form the operational foundation for the new supervisory approach.\nWhat the Regime Introduces One of the most significant updates is the introduction of Systemic Third-Party Services (STPS) — services whose disruption could threaten the stability or confidence of the UK financial system.\nDesignated CTPs must meet detailed requirements for STPS, including:\nConducting scenario testing Running incident management playbook exercises Sharing relevant information with regulators The regime becomes effective 1 January 2025, but will only apply after a provider is formally designated. The designation process will take at least six months, with the first designations expected around mid-2025.\nOnce designated, a CTP has three months to submit its first self-assessment report on STPS compliance.\nThe regulatory approach is aligned with international standards and ensures interoperability with other jurisdictions.\nOverall Objective of the Regime The regime aims to address systemic third-party concentration risk — the risk that a small number of external providers supply critical services to many financial institutions.\nIt builds on existing expectations set out in:\nSS1/21 SS2/21 The Operational Resilience policy statement These documents shape how financial institutions manage outsourcing, third-party risk, and impact tolerances for important business services.\nAWS Commitment This outcomes-based regime provides CTPs with flexibility in how they demonstrate compliance. It does not increase the regulatory burden on financial institutions, but supports a stronger, more resilient UK financial system.\nAWS fully supports the regulators’ objectives and values the continued engagement throughout this process. We are committed to:\nMeeting all regulatory requirements Helping customers understand AWS’s approach to the CTP regime Supporting customers in improving their operational resilience Impact on Customers Regulators have clarified that the regime does not remove or reduce the responsibilities of financial institutions, their boards, or senior management.\nImportantly, it does not impose new obligations directly on AWS customers.\nHowever, customers should expect to:\nProvide accurate information about their third-party dependencies Review and update their risk management and due-diligence processes Leverage new information shared by CTPs under the regime AWS already provides a wide range of services that support effective incident management, across both cloud-native and hybrid environments.\nGuidance on incident management is also available in the AWS Well-Architected Framework.\nIf you have questions about the regime or operational resilience practices — including incident management — contact your AWS account team.\nAbout the Authors Michael Jefferson Michael Jefferson is the Head of Public Policy for Financial Services at AWS, covering the UK, Middle East, Africa, and Switzerland. He co-leads AWS\u0026rsquo;s engagement with the Financial Stability Board (FSB). His background spans technology, industry associations, investment banking, and the UK public sector.\nArvind Kannan Arvind Kannan is a Principal Compliance Specialist at AWS based in London. He works closely with financial services customers across EMEA, focusing on governance, risk, compliance, and operational resilience, helping them navigate increasingly complex regulatory expectations.\n"

	"content": "VPC endpoints VPC endpoints are virtual devices. They are horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC components. They allow communication between your compute resources and AWS services without imposing availability risks. Compute resources running in VPC can access Amazon S3 using a Gateway endpoint. PrivateLink interface endpoints can be used by compute resources running in VPC or on-premises. Workshop overview In this workshop, you will use two VPCs.\n\u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; is for cloud resources such as a Gateway endpoint and an EC2 instance to test with. \u0026ldquo;VPC On-Prem\u0026rdquo; simulates an on-premises environment such as a factory or corporate datacenter. An EC2 instance running strongSwan VPN software has been deployed in \u0026ldquo;VPC On-prem\u0026rdquo; and automatically configured to establish a Site-to-Site VPN tunnel with AWS Transit Gateway. This VPN simulates connectivity from an on-premises location to the AWS cloud. To minimize costs, only one VPN instance is provisioned to support this workshop. When planning VPN connectivity for your production workloads, AWS recommends using multiple VPN devices for high availability. "

Connect to EC2 with session manager For this workshop, you will use AWS Session Manager to access several EC2 instances. Session Manager is a fully managed AWS Systems Manager capability that allows you to manage your Amazon EC2 instances and on-premises virtual machines (VMs) through an interactive one-click browser-based shell. Session Manager provides secure and auditable instance management without the need to open inbound ports, maintain bastion hosts, or manage SSH keys.\nFirst cloud journey Lab for indepth understanding of Session manager.\nIn the AWS Management Console, start typing Systems Manager in the quick search box and press Enter: From the Systems Manager menu, find Node Management in the left menu and click Session Manager: Click Start Session, and select the EC2 instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. This EC2 instance is already running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; and will be used to test connectivity to Amazon S3 through the Gateway endpoint you just created (s3-gwe).\nSession Manager will open a new browser tab with a shell prompt: sh-4.2 $\nYou have successfully start a session - connect to the EC2 instance in VPC cloud. In the next step, we will create a S3 bucket and a file in it.\nCreate a file and upload to s3 bucket Change to the ssm-user\u0026rsquo;s home directory by typing cd ~ in the CLI Create a new file to use for testing with the command fallocate -l 1G testfile.xyz, which will create a file of 1GB size named \u0026ldquo;testfile.xyz\u0026rdquo;. Upload file to S3 bucket with command aws s3 cp testfile.xyz s3://your-bucket-name. Replace your-bucket-name with the name of S3 bucket that you created earlier. You have successfully uploaded the file to your S3 bucket. You can now terminate the session.\nCheck object in S3 bucket Navigate to S3 console. Click the name of your s3 bucket In the Bucket console, you will see the file you have uploaded to your S3 bucket Section summary Congratulation on completing access to S3 from VPC. In this section, you created a Gateway endpoint for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to upload an object. The upload worked because the Gateway endpoint allowed communication to S3, without needing an Internet Gateway attached to \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo;. This demonstrates the functionality of the Gateway endpoint as a secure path to S3 without traversing the Public Internet.\n"

The Interface endpoint will allow you to route to Amazon S3 over a VPN connection from your simulated on-premises environment.\nWhy using Interface endpoint:\nGateway endpoints only work with resources running in the VPC where they are created. Interface endpoints work with resources running in VPC, and also resources running in on-premises environments. Connectivty from your on-premises environment to the cloud can be provided by AWS Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Interface endpoints allow you to connect to services powered by AWS PrivateLink. These services include some AWS services, services hosted by other AWS customers and partners in their own VPCs (referred to as PrivateLink Endpoint Services), and supported AWS Marketplace Partner services. For this workshop, we will focus on connecting to Amazon S3. "

Record type: keep default value (type A) Alias Button: Click to enable Route traffic to: Alias to VPC Endpoint Region: US East (N. Virginia) [us-east-1] Choose endpoint: Paste the Regional VPC Endpoint DNS name from your text editor The new records appear in the Route 53 console:\nCreate a Resolver Forwarding Rule Route 53 Resolver Forwarding Rules allow you to forward DNS queries from your VPC to other sources for name resolution. Outside of a workshop environment, you might use this feature to forward DNS queries from your VPC to DNS servers running on-premises. In this section, you will simulate an on-premises conditional forwarder by creating a forwarding rule that forwards DNS queries for Amazon S3 to a Private Hosted Zone running in \u0026ldquo;VPC Cloud\u0026rdquo; in-order to resolve the PrivateLink interface endpoint regional DNS name.\nFrom the Route 53 management console, click Inbound endpoints on the left side bar In the Inbound endpoints console, click the ID of the inbound endpoint Copy the two IP addresses listed to your text editor From the Route 53 menu, choose Resolver \u0026gt; Rules, and click Create rule: In the Create rule console: Name: myS3Rule Rule type: Forward Domain name: s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com VPC: VPC On-prem Outbound endpoint: VPCOnpremOutboundEndpoint Target IP Addresses: Enter both IP addresses from your text editor (inbound endpoint addresses) and then click Submit You have successfully created resolver forwarding rule.\nTest the on-premises DNS Simulation Connect to Test-Interface-Endpoint EC2 instance with Session manager Test DNS resolution. The dig command will return the IP addresses assigned to the VPC Interface endpoint running in VPC Cloud (your IP\u0026rsquo;s will be different): dig +short s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com The IP addresses returned are the VPC endpoint IP addresses, NOT the Resolver IP addresses you pasted from your text editor. The IP addresses of the Resolver endpoint and the VPC endpoint look similar because they are all from the VPC Cloud CIDR block.\nNavigate to the VPC menu (Endpoints section), select the S3 Interface endpoint. Click the Subnets tab and verify that the IP addresses returned by Dig match the VPC endpoint: Return to your shell and use the AWS CLI to test listing your S3 buckets: aws s3 ls --endpoint-url https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com Terminate your Session Manager session: In this section you created an Interface endpoint for Amazon S3. This endpoint can be reached from on-premises through Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect. Route 53 Resolver outbound endpoints simulated forwarding DNS requests from on-premises to a Private Hosted Zone running the cloud. Route 53 inbound Endpoints recieved the resolution request and returned a response containing the IP addresses of the VPC interface endpoint. Using DNS to resolve the endpoint IP addresses provides high availability in-case of an Availability Zone outage.\n"

	"content": "When you create an interface or gateway endpoint, you can attach an endpoint policy to it that controls access to the service to which you are connecting. A VPC endpoint policy is an IAM resource policy that you attach to an endpoint. If you do not attach a policy when you create an endpoint, AWS attaches a default policy for you that allows full access to the service through the endpoint.\nYou can create a policy that restricts access to specific S3 buckets only. This is useful if you only want certain S3 Buckets to be accessible through the endpoint.\nIn this section you will create a VPC endpoint policy that restricts access to the S3 bucket specified in the VPC endpoint policy.\nConnect to an EC2 instance and verify connectivity to S3 Start a new AWS Session Manager session on the instance named Test-Gateway-Endpoint. From the session, verify that you can list the contents of the bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC: aws s3 ls s3://\\\u0026lt;your-bucket-name\\\u0026gt; The bucket contents include the two 1 GB files uploaded in earlier.\nCreate a new S3 bucket; follow the naming pattern you used in Part 1, but add a \u0026lsquo;-2\u0026rsquo; to the name. Leave other fields as default and click create Successfully create bucket\nNavigate to: Services \u0026gt; VPC \u0026gt; Endpoints, then select the Gateway VPC endpoint you created earlier. Click the Policy tab. Click Edit policy. The default policy allows access to all S3 Buckets through the VPC endpoint.\nIn Edit Policy console, copy \u0026amp; Paste the following policy, then replace yourbucketname-2 with your 2nd bucket name. This policy will allow access through the VPC endpoint to your new bucket, but not any other bucket in Amazon S3. Click Save to apply the policy. { \u0026#34;Id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Policy1631305502445\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Version\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2012-10-17\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Statement\u0026#34;: [ { \u0026#34;Sid\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Stmt1631305501021\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Action\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;s3:*\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Effect\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Allow\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;Resource\u0026#34;: [ \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;arn:aws:s3:::yourbucketname-2/*\u0026#34; ], \u0026#34;Principal\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*\u0026#34; } ] } Successfully customize policy\nFrom your session on the Test-Gateway-Endpoint instance, test access to the S3 bucket you created in Part 1: Access S3 from VPC aws s3 ls s3://\u0026lt;yourbucketname\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy:\nReturn to your home directory on your EC2 instance cd~ Create a file fallocate -l 1G test-bucket2.xyz Copy file to 2nd bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-2nd-bucket-name\u0026gt; This operation succeeds because it is permitted by the VPC endpoint policy.\nThen we test access to the first bucket by copy the file to 1st bucket aws s3 cp test-bucket2.xyz s3://\u0026lt;your-1st-bucket-name\u0026gt; This command will return an error because access to this bucket is not permitted by your new VPC endpoint policy.\nPart 3 Summary: In this section, you created a VPC endpoint policy for Amazon S3, and used the AWS CLI to test the policy. AWS CLI actions targeted to your original S3 bucket failed because you applied a policy that only allowed access to the second bucket you created. AWS CLI actions targeted for your second bucket succeeded because the policy allowed them. These policies can be useful in situations where you need to control access to resources through VPC endpoints.\n"

	"content": "Secure Hybrid Access to S3 using VPC Endpoints Overview AWS PrivateLink provides private connectivity to AWS services from VPCs and your on-premises networks, without exposing your traffic to the Public Internet.\nIn this lab, you will learn how to create, configure, and test VPC endpoints that enable your workloads to reach AWS services without traversing the Public Internet.\nYou will create two types of endpoints to access Amazon S3: a Gateway VPC endpoint, and an Interface VPC endpoint. These two types of VPC endpoints offer different benefits depending on if you are accessing Amazon S3 from the cloud or your on-premises location\nGateway - Create a gateway endpoint to send traffic to Amazon S3 or DynamoDB using private IP addresses.You route traffic from your VPC to the gateway endpoint using route tables. Interface - Create an interface endpoint to send traffic to endpoint services that use a Network Load Balancer to distribute traffic. Traffic destined for the endpoint service is resolved using DNS.

	"content": "Overall Evaluation 1. Working Environment\nThe working environment is very friendly and open. FCJ members are always willing to help whenever I encounter difficulties, even outside working hours. The workspace is tidy and comfortable, helping me focus better. However, I think it would be nice to have more social gatherings or team bonding activities to strengthen relationships.\n2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin\nThe mentor provides very detailed guidance, explains clearly when I don’t understand, and always encourages me to ask questions. The admin team supports administrative tasks, provides necessary documents, and creates favorable conditions for me to work effectively. I especially appreciate that the mentor allows me to try and solve problems myself instead of just giving the answer.\n3. Relevance of Work to Academic Major\nThe tasks I was assigned align well with the knowledge I learned at university, while also introducing me to new areas I had never encountered before. This allowed me to both strengthen my foundational knowledge and gain practical skills.\n4. Learning \u0026amp; Skill Development Opportunities\nDuring the internship, I learned many new skills such as using project management tools, teamwork skills, and professional communication in a corporate environment. The mentor also shared valuable real-world experiences that helped me better plan my career path.\n5. Company Culture \u0026amp; Team Spirit\nThe company culture is very positive: everyone respects each other, works seriously but still keeps things enjoyable. When there are urgent projects, everyone works together and supports one another regardless of their position. This made me feel like a real part of the team, even as an intern.\n6. Internship Policies / Benefits\nThe company provides an internship allowance and offers flexible working hours when needed. In addition, having the opportunity to join internal training sessions is a big plus.\nAdditional Questions What did you find most satisfying during your internship? What do you think the company should improve for future interns? If recommending to a friend, would you suggest they intern here? Why or why not? Suggestions \u0026amp; Expectations Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience? Would you like to continue this program in the future? Any other comments (free sharing): "
